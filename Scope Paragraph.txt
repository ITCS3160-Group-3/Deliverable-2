The goal of this project is to update an existing campus food delivery database. This database maintains information on students, faculty, staff and drivers, 
as well as available delivery drivers, restaurants and food dropoff locations. The project will add a rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers.
In addition, new procedures will be added to the database that will provide the highest and lowest ranked drivers and restaurants. Lastly, various queries 
and query optimizations will be included, and all work will be summarized in a narrated powerpoint presentation.

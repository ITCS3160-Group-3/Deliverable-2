# ITCS 3160-054 - Spring 2021 - Project Group 3

Group Members: David Osunkwo, Austin Rogers, Alec Roseberry, Seth Little, Prem Patel

The purpose of this project is to extend a prototype for a database that is not a fully implemented working model. The existing prototype is for a campus food delivery startup that connects with local restaurants and sources delivery from university employees. This allows universities to have greater control over the flow of deliviery drivers into and out of campus. This is important amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. 

To meet these requirements, multiple tables will be needed to store information about the students, the student's orders, the restauruants that are partnered, as well as the drivers, deliveries, vehicles, location, and staff. The project will also add a rating system for both drivers and restaurants.

## Business Rules:
* A Person cannot give a Driver a rating before the delivery is complete.
* A Person cannot give a restaurant multiple ratings.
* A Person will be able to modify their rating of both Drivers and restaurants.
* A Person will be able to view ratings of potential restaurants.
* Drivers and Restaurants will be able to review their own ratings.
* A Person must have placed an order with the restaurant to leave a rating.
